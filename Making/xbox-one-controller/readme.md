Created to match the look of the Xbox One Controller (1708 model specifically, but still close to xbox-one controller in general).
Gray and yellow theme was used to maintain close resemblance to the original preset for Xbox 360 Controller.
Prefer using .json config and the 5.0 plugin version, but the old .ini file should still work.

Extra notes:
Font used for controller numbering - Titan One
Available .xcf file is super messy, but if someone wants to edit the preset, it may make the job slightly easier
